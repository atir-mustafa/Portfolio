        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="Atir.jpg" alt="Me" id="pp">
        <p>My name is <strong><b>Atir Mustafa</b></strong>, and I am a dedicated <b>Front-end developer</b> currently pursuing a <strong><b>Diploma in Computer Engineering</b></strong> at <b>Jamia Millia Islamia University</b>. My academic journey has provided me with a solid technical foundation and an in-depth understanding of web technologies, user interfaces, and the design principles that drive successful digital experiences.</p>
        <p>As a front-end developer, I specialize in creating <b>responsive, accessible, and visually appealing</b> websites. I have a strong command of <strong><b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b></strong>, and I enjoy bringing designs to life with interactive elements and smooth user interfaces. My passion lies in crafting digital experiences that are not only functional but also engaging for users.</p>
        <p>While my expertise is currently focused on front-end development, I am in the process of expanding my knowledge by exploring <strong><b>back-end technologies</b></strong>. Iâ€™m eager to broaden my skill set and gain proficiency in <b>server-side programming and databases</b>, which will enable me to build full-fledged web applications in the future. Though I am a beginner in back-end development, I am motivated to learn and embrace this new challenge as part of my journey.</p>
        <p>Beyond technical skills, I value creativity, attention to detail, and clear communication. I believe in collaborating with designers and other developers to ensure that every project not only meets technical requirements but also achieves an exceptional user experience.</p>
        <p id="pe">With my current skill set and my drive to grow as a developer, I am committed to continuously enhancing my abilities and delivering high-quality front-end solutions that prioritize usability and design. My goal is to eventually bridge my knowledge gap and become proficient in <strong><b>full-stack development</b></strong>, enabling me to contribute to comprehensive and impactful web projects.</p>
